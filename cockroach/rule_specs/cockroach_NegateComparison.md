NegateComparison inverts eligible comparison operators when they are negated
by the Not operator. For example, Eq maps to Ne, and Gt maps to Le. All
comparisons can be negated except for the JSON and Geospatial comparisons.

Extracted from `bool.opt` (which defines multiple rules — implement specifically `NegateComparison`, not the other rules in that file):
