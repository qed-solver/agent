AssociateLimitJoinsLeft reorders an InnerJoin and LeftJoin under a Limit if:
1. The InnerJoin does not preserve rows from its left input.
2. The InnerJoin's ON condition does not reference the right side of the
LeftJoin (because the reordering would be invalid).
3. Neither join has join hints.

Why condition #1? If the InnerJoin preserves left rows, the limit can already
be pushed down into the LeftJoin, so there's no need to reorder the joins.

Here's the transformation:

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT * FROM xy LEFT JOIN uv ON u = x)
INNER JOIN ab
ON a = y
LIMIT 10
=>
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT * FROM xy INNER JOIN ab ON a = y)
LEFT JOIN uv
ON u = x
LIMIT 10
