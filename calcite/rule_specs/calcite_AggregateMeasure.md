Note: MeasureRules.java defines multiple distinct rule variants as separate static nested classes. Implement specifically the `AggregateMeasureRule` variant (not AggregateMeasure2Rule, ProjectMeasureRule, FilterSortMeasureRule, ProjectSortMeasureRule, which are separate rules ported under their own spec names).
