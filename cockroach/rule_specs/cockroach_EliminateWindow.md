# Name: EliminateWindow
# Backend: CockroachDB
# Source: pkg/sql/opt/norm/rules/window.opt

EliminateWindow removes a Window operator with no window functions (which can
occur via column pruning).

Extracted from `window.opt` (which defines multiple rules — implement specifically `EliminateWindow`, not the other rules in that file):

```
# EliminateWindow removes a Window operator with no window functions (which can
# occur via column pruning).
[EliminateWindow, Normalize]
(Window $input:* [])
=>
$input
```
