# PushFilterIntoJoinLeft

**Status:** PROVED  **Scope:** PARTIAL
**Source backend:** CockroachDB
**Porter attempts used:** 22  **Verification rounds used:** 2
**Scope detail:** INNER join only (no Semi/Left/Full/Anti), one left-bound conjunct with no outer columns, one unbound conjunct, single-column inputs


## Source rule (as given to the porter)

```
Source: pkg/sql/opt/norm/rules/join.opt

PushFilterIntoJoinLeft pushes Join filter conditions into the left side of the
join. This is possible in the case of InnerJoin, as long as the condition has
no dependencies on the right side of the join. Left and Full joins are not
eligible, since filtering left rows will change the number of rows in the
result for those types of joins:

-- A row with nulls on the right side is returned for a.x=1, a.y=2, b.x=1.
SELECT * FROM a LEFT JOIN b ON a.x=b.x AND a.y < 0

-- But if the filter is incorrectly pushed down, then no row is returned.
SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM a WHERE a.y < 0) a LEFT JOIN b ON a.x=b.x

In addition, AntiJoin is not eligible for this rule, as illustrated by this
example:

-- A row is returned for a.y=2.
SELECT * FROM a ANTI JOIN b ON a.y < 0

-- But if the filter is incorrectly pushed down, then no row is returned.
SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM a WHERE a.y < 0) a ANTI JOIN b ON True

## Independent verifier review

**Verdict:** CONFIRMED

`before()` (inner join with conjuncts `f(L) ∧ g(L,R)`) and `after()` (left filtered by `f(L)`, then joined on `g(L,R)`) are structurally different, share the same uninterpreted symbols `f`, `g`, and the L column (so `f` is genuinely left-bound in both and correctly identified as the pushed conjunct), making the QED proof non-vacuous and semantically valid for inner joins; the narrowing to INNER-only with one left-bound/one unbound conjunct and single-column inputs is a genuine, honestly-labeled (PARTIAL), non-degenerate special case of the source rule.
