# Name: CommuteConstInequality
# Backend: CockroachDB
# Source: pkg/sql/opt/norm/rules/comp.opt

CommuteConstInequality is similar to CommuteConst (in scalar.opt), except
that it handles inequality comparison operators that need special handling to
commute operands.

Extracted from `comp.opt` (which defines multiple rules — implement specifically `CommuteConstInequality`, not the other rules in that file):

```
# CommuteConstInequality is similar to CommuteConst (in scalar.opt), except
# that it handles inequality comparison operators that need special handling to
# commute operands.
[CommuteConstInequality, Normalize]
(Le | Lt | Ge | Gt $left:(ConstValue) $right:^(ConstValue))
=>
(CommuteInequality (OpName) $left $right)
```
