SimplifyTrueAnd simplifies the And operator by discarding a True condition on
the left side.

Extracted from `bool.opt` (which defines multiple rules — implement specifically `SimplifyTrueAnd`, not the other rules in that file):

```
# SimplifyTrueAnd simplifies the And operator by discarding a True condition on
# the left side.
[SimplifyTrueAnd, Normalize]
(And (True) $right:*)
=>
$right
```
