ConvertGroupByToDistinct converts a GroupBy operator that has no aggregations
to an equivalent DistinctOn operator.

Extracted from `groupby.opt` (which defines multiple rules — implement specifically `ConvertGroupByToDistinct`, not the other rules in that file):

```
# ConvertGroupByToDistinct converts a GroupBy operator that has no aggregations
# to an equivalent DistinctOn operator.
[ConvertGroupByToDistinct, Normalize]
(GroupBy $input:* $aggregations:[] $groupingPrivate:*)
=>
(DistinctOn $input $aggregations $groupingPrivate)
```
