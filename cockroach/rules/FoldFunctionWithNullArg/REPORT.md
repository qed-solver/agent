# FoldFunctionWithNullArg

**Status:** PROVED  **Scope:** PARTIAL
**Source backend:** CockroachDB
**Porter attempts used:** 41  **Verification rounds used:** 3
**Scope detail:** encodes the rule for the concrete normal null-propagating function EQUALS, with the NULL literal as its second argument and an arbitrary first argument (a scan column), in projection position; full generality (any null-propagating function, any argument position, any scalar position) is unprovable because QED does not lift null through uninterpreted function symbols (re-verified: the uninterpreted f(x, NULL) -> NULL encoding produces a clean QED JSON yet yields provable=false)


## Source rule (as given to the porter)

```
Source: pkg/sql/opt/norm/rules/fold_constants.opt

FoldFunctionWithNullArg folds a Function to Null when one of its arguments is
Null and all of the following are true:

1. The function is not called when any of its inputs are null
(CalledOnNullInput=false).
2. The function is a normal function not an aggregate, window, or generator.

It is safe to fold functions to Null in this case because a function with
CalledOnNullInput=false would never error with a Null argument, even if the
other args are invalid. For example, calling encode with NULL bytes and an
invalid encoding format does not error:

SELECT encode(NULL::BYTES, 'foo')
=> NULL

Stable and volatile functions that rely on context or produce side-effects can
also be folded to Null in this case because a function with
CalledOnNullInput=false is never evaluated if any of its arguments are Null.
The function results directly in Null without being invoked, so it is
guaranteed not to rely on context or produce side-effects. See
Overload.CalledOnNullInput for more details.

FoldFunctionWithNullArg is defined before FoldFunction so that we can avoid
the overhead of evaluating the function in FoldFunction if it has any Null
arguments.

## Independent verifier review

**Verdict:** CONFIRMED

before() and after() are structurally different (projecting EQUALS(x, NULL) vs a bare BOOLEAN null), and the proof is non-vacuous: it succeeds only because QED's model gives `=` genuine three-valued null-propagation semantics, and the porter's re-verified provable=false for an uninterpreted f(x, NULL) rules out a vacuous or over-constrained shortcut. The encoding is a faithful, specific special case of FoldFunctionWithNullArg — EQUALS is a normal (non-aggregate/window/generator) function that is not invoked on null input, the null argument satisfies HasNullArg, and full generality is genuinely out of reach since the DSL cannot express function-metadata side conditions and QED has no null-propagation contract for uninterpreted function symbols. The SCOPE: PARTIAL line accurately and specifically discloses exactly this restriction. ```
