Source: pkg/sql/opt/norm/rules/scalar.opt

ConvertUncorrelatedExistsToCoalesceSubquery converts an uncorrelated Exists
expression to a Coalesce expression with a Subquery. For example:

SELECT EXISTS (
SELECT * FROM b
) FROM a
=>
SELECT COALESCE(
(SELECT true FROM (SELECT * FROM b) LIMIT 1),
false
) FROM a

This transformation simplifies execbuilder and execution code - we do not need
a special execution mode for uncorrelated Exists.

Note: We can use an empty ordering for the Limit because Exists never have an
ordering.

## Independent verifier review

**Verdict:** AGREE

The rule's right-hand side — COALESCE of a scalar subquery projecting true over `input LIMIT 1` with false — equals EXISTS(input) only by virtue of LIMIT's emptiness-preserving behavior, the scalar subquery's "zero rows ⇒ NULL" semantics, and COALESCE's null-skip algebra. QED explicitly does not model Sort/Limit/Offset (no bag-semantic meaning) and cannot reason about a scalar operator's bespoke null semantics — COALESCE would remain an uninterpreted symbol — so no honest encoding of the RHS exists that the prover can check, and extending the DSL with builders cannot help since the missing piece is the prover, which is off-limits. UNSUPPORTED is therefore the correct verdict even though the porter's actual failure was a context-length infrastructure error rather than a failed proof attempt.
