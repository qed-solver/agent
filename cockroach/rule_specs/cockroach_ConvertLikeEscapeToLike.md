ConvertLikeEscapeToLike converts a LIKE x ESCAPE '\' expression, which is
parsed as a like_escape function call, to a LIKE expression. This is valid
because the default escape character is '\'.

Note that the FunctionExpr match pattern is enough to ensure that we are not
transforming a UDF because UDF invocations are always built as UDFCallExprs.

Extracted from `scalar.opt` (which defines multiple rules — implement specifically `ConvertLikeEscapeToLike`, not the other rules in that file):
