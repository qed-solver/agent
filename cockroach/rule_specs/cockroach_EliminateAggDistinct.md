EliminateAggDistinct removes AggDistinct for aggregations where DISTINCT
never modifies the result; for example: min(DISTINCT x).

Extracted from `agg.opt` (which defines multiple rules — implement specifically `EliminateAggDistinct`, not the other rules in that file):

```
# EliminateAggDistinct removes AggDistinct for aggregations where DISTINCT
# never modifies the result; for example: min(DISTINCT x).
[EliminateAggDistinct, Normalize]
(AggDistinct $input:(Min | Max | BoolAnd | BoolOr))
=>
$input
```
