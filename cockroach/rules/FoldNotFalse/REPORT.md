# FoldNotFalse

**Status:** PROVED  **Scope:** FULL
**Source backend:** CockroachDB
**Porter attempts used:** 4  **Verification rounds used:** 1
**Scope detail:** public record FoldNotFalse() implements RRule {


## Source rule (as given to the porter)

```
Source: pkg/sql/opt/norm/rules/bool.opt

FoldNotFalse replaces NOT(False) with True.

Extracted from `bool.opt` (which defines multiple rules — implement specifically `FoldNotFalse`, not the other rules in that file):

```
# FoldNotFalse replaces NOT(False) with True.
[FoldNotFalse, Normalize]
(Not (False))
=>
(True)
```
```

## Independent verifier review

**Verdict:** CONFIRMED

The encoding is non-vacuous (Filter(Not(False), R) vs. Filter(True, R) are structurally distinct) and matches the source rule term-for-term: FoldNotFalse is a closed, non-schematic rewrite NOT(FALSE) ⟹ TRUE with no variables to leave uninterpreted, so the unconstrained scan is a neutral carrier, the filter condition is the DSL's minimal relational vehicle for a boolean term (same carrier as the FilterMerge example), and no rule instance is left out — the DSL has no expression-level hole to quantify over arbitrary positions, so this is as general as the rule can be expressed here, making the FULL tag honest. No preconditions (keys, NOT NULL) are involved and the literal is non-null, so no null-semantics edge case is silently dropped; the 0.26 ms proof is simply reflecting that the rule's content is a trivial constant identity, not a degenerate encoding.
