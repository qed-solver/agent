# Name: EliminateExistsProject
# Backend: CockroachDB
# Source: pkg/sql/opt/norm/rules/scalar.opt

EliminateExistsProject discards a Project input to the Exists operator. The
Project operator never changes the row cardinality of its input, and row
cardinality is the only thing that Exists cares about, so Project is a no-op.

Extracted from `scalar.opt` (which defines multiple rules — implement specifically `EliminateExistsProject`, not the other rules in that file):

```
# EliminateExistsProject discards a Project input to the Exists operator. The
# Project operator never changes the row cardinality of its input, and row
# cardinality is the only thing that Exists cares about, so Project is a no-op.
[EliminateExistsProject, Normalize]
(Exists (Project $input:*) $existsPrivate:*)
=>
(Exists $input $existsPrivate)
```
